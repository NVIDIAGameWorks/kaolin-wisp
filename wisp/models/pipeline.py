    """Base class for implementing neural field pipelines.

    Pipelines consist of several components:

        - Neural fields (``self.nef``) which take coordinates as input and outputs signals.
          These usually consist of several optional components:

            - A feature grid (``self.nef.grid``)
              Sometimes also known as 'hybrid representations'.
            - An acceleration structure (``self.nef.grid.blas``) which can be used to accelerate spatial queries.
            - A decoder (``self.net.decoder``) which can take the features (or coordinates, or embeddings) and covert it to signals.

        - A forward map (``self.tracer``) which is a function which will invoke the pipeline in
          some outer loop. Usually this consists of renderers which will output a RenderBuffer object.
    
    The 'Pipeline' classes are responsible for holding and orchestrating these components.
