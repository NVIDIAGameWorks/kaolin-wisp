class BaseNeuralField(WispModule):
    """The base class for all Neural Fields within Wisp.
    Neural Fields are defined as modules which take coordinates as input and output signals of some form.
    The term "Neural" is loosely used here to imply these modules are generally subject for optimization.

    The domain of neural fields in Wisp is flexible, and left up for the user to decide when implementing the subclass.
    Popular neural fields from the literature, such as Neural Radiance Fields (Mildenhall et al. 2020),
    and Neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) can be implemented by creating and registering
    the required forward functions (for i.e. rgb, density, sdf values).

    BaseNeuralField subclasses  usually consist of several optional components:
    - A feature grid (BLASGrid), sometimes also known as 'hybrid representations'.
      These are responsible for querying and interpolating features, often in the context of some 3D volume
      (but not limited to).
      Feature grids often employ some acceleration structure (i.e. OctreeAS),
      which can be used to accelerate spatial queries or raytracing ops,
      hence the term "BLAS" (Bottom Level Acceleration Structure).
    - A decoder (i.e. BasicDecoder) which can feeds on features (or coordinates / pos embeddings) and coverts
      them to output signals.
    - Other components such as positional embedders may be employed.

    BaseNeuralFields are generally meant to be compatible with BaseTracers, thus forming a complete pipeline of
    render-able neural primitives.
