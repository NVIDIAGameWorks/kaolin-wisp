    """ A field based on Structured Point Clouds (SPC) from kaolin.
    SPC is a hierarchical compressed data structure, which can be interpreted in various ways:
    * Quantized point cloud, where each sparse point is quantized to some (possibly very dense) grid.
      Each point is associated with some feature(s).
    * An Octree, where each cell center is represented by a quantized point.
    Throughout wisp, SPCs are used to implement efficient octrees or grid structures.
    This field class allows wisp to render SPCs directly with their feature content (hence no embedders or decoders
    are assumed).

    When rendered, SPCs behave like octrees which allow for efficient tracing.
    Feature samples per ray may be collected from each intersected "cell" of the structured point cloud.
