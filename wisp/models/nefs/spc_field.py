class SPCField(BaseNeuralField):
    """ A field based on Structured Point Clouds (SPC) from kaolin.
    SPC is a hierarchical compressed data structure, which can be interpreted in various ways:
    * Quantized point cloud, where each sparse point is quantized to some (possibly very dense) grid.
      Each point is associated with some feature(s).
    * An Octree, where each cell center is represented by a quantized point.
    Throughout wisp, SPCs are used to implement efficient octrees or grid structures.
    This field class allows wisp to render SPCs directly with their feature content (hence no embedders or decoders
    are assumed).

    When rendered, SPCs behave like octrees which allow for efficient tracing.
    Feature samples per ray may be collected from each intersected "cell" of the structured point cloud.

        Creates a new Structured Point Cloud (SPC), represented as a Wisp Field.
        In wisp, SPCs are considered neural fields, since their features may be optimized.

        Args:
            octree (torch.ByteTensor):
                A tensor which holds the topology of the SPC.
                Each byte represents a single octree cell's occupancy (that is, each bit of that byte represents
                the occupancy status of a child octree cell), yielding 8 bits for 8 cells.
                See also https://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/spc_summary.html
            features_dict (dict):
                A dictionary holding the features information of the SPC.
                Keys are assumed to be a subset of ('colors', 'normals').
                Values are torch feature tensors containing information per point, of shape
                :math:`(\text{num_points}, \text{feat_dim})`.
                Where `num_points` is the number of occupied cells in the SPC.
                See `kaolin.ops.conversions.pointcloud.unbatched_pointcloud_to_spc` for conversion of point
                cloud information to such features.
            device (torch.device):
                Torch device on which the features and topology of the SPC field will be stored.
            base_lod (int):
                Number of levels of detail without features the SPC will use.
            num_lods (int):
                Number of levels of detail with features the SPC will use.
                The total number of levels the SPC will have is `base_lod + num_lods - 1`.
            optimizable (bool):
                A flag which determines if this SPCField supports optimization or not.
                Toggling optimization off allows for quick creation of SPCField objects.
