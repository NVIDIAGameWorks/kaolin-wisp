    which are actually occupied by the mesh. It also allows for equal distribution of samples per the octree cells.
    The dataset supports online resampling during training. Resampling is quick as a pool of narrowband values is
    cached for the duration of training, this pool is quickly subsampled each time resample() is invoked.
    Samples can also optionally include rgb information when the mesh is textured with materials.
